                <h3>1759</h3>
                <p>
                    Published <cite>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</cite>, 
                    discussing how human morality depends on sympathy 
                    between society and individuals, coining the term
                    "mutual sympathy" which is best summed up as empathy.
                </p>

                <h3>1762</h3>
                <p>
                    Received the title of Doctor of Laws from The University 
                    of Glasgow.
                </p>

                <h3>1763</h3>
                <p>
                    Charles Townshend hires Smith to teach his stepson, 
                    Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigns 
                    partway through the next year, attempting to return 
                    fees to his students. However, they refused because
                    they greatly enjoyed his lectures.
                </p>

                <h3>1764 to 1766</h3>
                <p>
                    Touring Europe with Scott, Smith travels to Paris where 
                    he meets the Physiocrats who argue France should
                    focus solely on agriculture since it maintained the 
                    country's wealth despite mercantilist ventures
                    and wars abroad. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This stark comparison between productive
                    and unproductive labor inspires Smith. 
                    The tour ends shortly after Scott's 
                    younger brother's death.
                </p>
