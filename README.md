On the site, there is a brief profile of Adam Smith and a timeline detailing events during his life.
The site is meant to be simple in order to help me practice using HTML, CSS, and the Flexbox.
I have learned quite a lot about web development, especially about the use of semantic elements
and CSS selectors.

This project is complete. I might end up revising it at some point but for the most part, it is finished.
